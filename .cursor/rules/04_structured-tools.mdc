- Every tool must have a machine-readable JSON Schema stored in `/ops/tool-schemas/<tool>.json`.
- Assistant must not emit free-text API calls. All tool invocations must conform to the schema.
- If JSON Schema validation fails, return an `error` object describing which field failed and why.
- Example tool invocation snippet:

```json
{
  "action":"send_email",
  "params": {"to":"x@y", "subject":"...", "body":"..."}
}
```
