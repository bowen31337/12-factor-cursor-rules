- Always list sources used for context (vector chunks, docs, session state) at the top of the response.
- Prefer retrieval â†’ summarize pipeline: Retriever -> top-K chunks -> compressor -> short summary.
- Do not exceed the configured context budget: if >budget, compress oldest or least-relevant content first.
- Use explicit markers: [CONTEXT-START] ... [CONTEXT-END].
