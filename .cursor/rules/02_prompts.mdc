- Treat prompts as code: reference a prompt id and short description.
- Each generated prompt should include a one-line "purpose" and "constraints" section.
- When editing prompts, produce a changelog comment: `PROMPT-CHANGE: <date> <reason>`.
- Prefer modular prompt fragments (system + persona + task + constraints) and reference them by name.
