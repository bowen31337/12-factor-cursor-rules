description: Convert NL intent into validated tool calls (canonical format).

When asked to take action, the assistant **must** produce a structured action object (not freeform text) with this canonical shape:

```json
{
  "action": "<tool_name>",
  "params": { /* object â€” follow tool schema */ },
  "confidence": 0.0,
  "explain": "one-line rationale"
}
```

Validation rules:
- If `confidence < 0.6`, ask a clarifying question instead of executing.
- Always ensure `params` conform to the tool's JSON Schema (see 04_structured-tools).
- Do not invent side-effects: propose actions only for tools defined in the repo.
